# OmniPatcher
Omnipatcher is a modification/skin-changer client for the Valve game Dota 2.

## Description
Omnipatcher is fully automatic, meaning that all the available items for installation are discovered in the game files and loaded without any moderation or other human influence. This means that all new items will be available as soon as they are added to the game. However this also means that there are likely to be both non-fatal and fatal errors when installing unusual items or when Valve changes the format in some way.  
Omnipatcher is a non-injecting skin changer. It does not inject any code into Dota dlls or edit any existing game files except gameinfo.gi This means that it isn't classified as a cheat by the Valve Anticheat (VAC). Unfortunately this means that not all items can be installed perfectly. For example custom animations or effects, which are usually absent may not install and are known to be problematic.
